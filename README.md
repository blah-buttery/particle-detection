# Deep Learning Model for Nanoparticle Detection

## Overview

This project implements nanoparticle detection using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) combined with contrastive loss and clustering strategies. The goal is to enable unsupervised particle discovery and improve detection performance through latent space refinement.

## Project Directory Overview

This repository is organized to support **training, evaluation, and visualization** for nanoparticle detection using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with contrastive loss and clustering techniques.

### **Top-Level Files and Directories:**

| Path                      | Description                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config/`                 | Contains configuration JSON files for training and evaluation setup. |
| `examples/`               | Example jupyter notebooks for running clustering and evaluation.               |
| `particle_detection/`     | Main source code including data loading, VAE model, training, evaluation, and clustering utilities. |
| `.gitattributes`          | Configures Git LFS to handle large model checkpoint files (`.pth`).   |
| `.gitignore`              | Specifies files and directories to ignore (e.g., outputs, cache files, visualization artifacts). |
| `README.md`               | This documentation file.                                             |
| `requirements.txt`        | Lists Python package dependencies required to run the project.       |

## **Notes:**
- The project follows a **modular structure**, separating core model logic, utilities, and example usage for easier development and testing.

## How to Use

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blah-buttery/particle-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd particle-detection
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Training the model

To train the variational autoencoder model, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m particle_detection.vae.train_model --config config/training_config.json
```

This will save the model in the `saved_models` directory.

> **Note:** Any parameters specified in the config file can be overridden directly from the command line.  
> For example:  
> ```bash
> python3 -m particle_detection.vae.train_model --config config/training_config.json --num_epochs 100 --batch_size 32
> ```

> **Tip:** Use the `--help` flag with any script to see available arguments.  
> Example:  
> ```bash
> python3 -m particle_detection.vae.train_model --help
> ```

> **Note:** GPU acceleration is supported. For multi-GPU training, use the `--is_ddp` flag.

### Evaluating the model

To evaluate the variational autoencoder model, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m particle_detection.vae.eval --config config/eval_config.json
```

> **Note:** As with training, evaluation parameters from the config file can be overridden using command-line arguments.
