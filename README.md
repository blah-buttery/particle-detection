## ðŸ“„ Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains supporting documentation for the project, including:

- **Weekly Reports:** Summaries of weekly progress, tasks completed, challenges faced, and plans for the following week.
- **Final Report:** Comprehensive overview of the project, including methodology, results, evaluation metrics, and conclusions.
- **PowerPoint:** Presentation slides for the final project demonstration, covering goals, design, implementation, testing, and lessons learned.


This section serves as a living document of the project's progress, decisions, and results.

## **Notes:**
- The project follows a **modular structure**, separating core model logic, utilities, and example usage for easier development and testing.

## Training the model
To train the variational autoencoder model, run the following command:
```bash
python3 -m particle_detection.vae.train_model --config config/training_config.json
```
This will save the model in the saved directory 

To evaluate the variational autoencoder model, run the following command:
```bash
python -m particle_detection.vae.train_model --num_epochs 10 --batch_size 128 \            
    --learning_rate 0.01 --data_dir ./patches_dataset --image_size 128 128
```
